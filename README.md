# NOTES

- add fireflies one by one in the network
- create several groups of fireflies, their center frequencies can be modifed by the system :
  two prblems must be resolved :
  - the groups must be merged when at the same frequencies, if not, leads to an offset problem
  - if a polymetry is created, the first beat must be shared among groups
  - how to change the timbre of the groups to allow recognition

- use tilting to slightly modify the frequency of the sine instead of random
- shake should add randomness into the firefly frequency


- when all fireflies are in the system, unlock sine frequency modification with tilting
  use a kind of stair function to stay ~tuned
  
- fireflies groups appears, from sync -> polyrythm -> random

when random unlock a touch interface playing with a granular synthesis (which material ?)
